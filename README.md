# 🖼️ Image Slider / Carousel Project

## 📋 Project Description
This project is a **responsive image slider (carousel)** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It automatically transitions between images while allowing manual navigation through **Next** and **Previous** buttons.  
The slider loops infinitely, includes smooth transitions, and indicates the current image using dots.

This project demonstrates key front-end development skills such as:
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- CSS animations and transitions
- Responsive design
- JavaScript timing functions

3. **JavaScript** controls:
   - Showing and hiding slides  
   - Looping through images  
   - Responding to user clicks  
   - Running an auto-slide every 3 seconds
